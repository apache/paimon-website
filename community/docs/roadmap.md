# Roadmap

This roadmap means to provide users and contributors with a high-level summary of ongoing efforts in the Paimon community.
The roadmap contains both efforts working in process as well as completed efforts, so that users may get a better impression
of the overall status and direction of those developments.

## Paimon 2.0 Planning

Apache Paimon, as a high-performance data lake format, has achieved significant results in the field of structured data processing.
With the deepening of AI application scenarios, the demand for fusion analysis of multimodal data (such as text, images, audio, video, etc.)
is increasing day by day. We have invested a lot of development work in cross modal retrieval, unified storage, and efficient analysis.

Paimon 2.0 development, focusing on breaking through multimodal data support and creating a more powerful data lake solution.

Core objective:
- Unified Storage for structure & multimodal & vector.
- Efficient Search for data and vectors and full text.
- PyPaimon integrate to AI system like Ray, Pytorch.

Umbrella issue is https://github.com/apache/paimon/issues/6866
