      <description>Overview #  Apache Paimon&amp;rsquo;s Architecture:
As shown in the architecture above:
Read/Write: Paimon supports a versatile way to read/write data and perform OLAP queries.
 For reads, it supports consuming data  from historical snapshots (in batch mode), from the latest offset (in streaming mode), or reading incremental snapshots in a hybrid way.   For writes, it supports  streaming synchronization from the changelog of databases (CDC) batch insert/overwrite from offline data.</description>

      <description>Basic Concepts #  File Layouts #  All files of a table are stored under one base directory. Paimon files are organized in a layered style. The following image illustrates the file layout. Starting from a snapshot file, Paimon readers can recursively access all records from the table.
Snapshot #  All snapshot files are stored in the snapshot directory.
A snapshot file is a JSON file containing information about this snapshot, including</description>

      <description>Concurrency Control #  Paimon supports optimistic concurrency for multiple concurrent write jobs.
Each job writes data at its own pace and generates a new snapshot based on the current snapshot by applying incremental files (deleting or adding files) at the time of committing.
There may be two types of commit failures here:
 Snapshot conflict: the snapshot id has been preempted, the table has generated a new snapshot from another job.</description>

      <description>Catalog #  Paimon provides a Catalog abstraction to manage the table of contents and metadata. The Catalog abstraction provides a series of ways to help you better integrate with computing engines. We always recommend that you use Catalog to access the Paimon table.
Catalogs #  Paimon catalogs currently support four types of metastores:
 filesystem metastore (default), which stores both metadata and table files in filesystems. hive metastore, which additionally stores metadata in Hive metastore.</description>

      <description>System Tables #  Paimon provides a very rich set of system tables to help users better analyze and query the status of Paimon tables:
 Query the status of the data table: Data System Table. Query the global status of the entire Catalog: Global System Table.  Data System Table #  Data System tables contain metadata and information about each Paimon data table, such as the snapshots created and the options in use.</description>

      <description>Data Types #  A data type describes the logical type of a value in the table ecosystem. It can be used to declare input and/or output types of operations.
All data types supported by Paimon are as follows:
  DataType Description     BOOLEAN Data type of a boolean with a (possibly) three-valued logic of TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN.   CHAR
CHAR(n)  Data type of a fixed-length character string.</description>

      <description>Functions #  Paimon introduces a Function abstraction designed to support functions in a standard format for compute engine, addressing:
  Unified Column-Level Filtering and Processing: Facilitates operations at the column level, including tasks such as encryption and decryption of data.
  Parameterized View Capabilities: Supports parameterized operations within views, enhancing the dynamism and usability of data retrieval processes.
  Types of Functions Supported #  Currently, Paimon supports three types of functions:</description>

      <description>Views #  A view is a logical table that encapsulates business logic and domain-specific semantics. While most compute engines support views natively, each engine stores view metadata in proprietary formats, creating interoperability challenges across different platforms. Paimon views abstracting engine-specific query dialects and establishing unified metadata standards. View metadata could enable centralized view management that facilitates cross-engine sharing and reduces maintenance complexity in heterogeneous computing environments.
Catalog support #  View metadata is persisted only when the catalog implementation supports it:</description>
