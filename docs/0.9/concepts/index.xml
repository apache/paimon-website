      <description>Overview #  Apache Paimon&amp;rsquo;s Architecture:
As shown in the architecture above:
Read/Write: Paimon supports a versatile way to read/write data and perform OLAP queries.
 For reads, it supports consuming data  from historical snapshots (in batch mode), from the latest offset (in streaming mode), or reading incremental snapshots in a hybrid way.   For writes, it supports  streaming synchronization from the changelog of databases (CDC) batch insert/overwrite from offline data.</description>

      <description>Basic Concepts #  File Layouts #  All files of a table are stored under one base directory. Paimon files are organized in a layered style. The following image illustrates the file layout. Starting from a snapshot file, Paimon readers can recursively access all records from the table.
Snapshot #  All snapshot files are stored in the snapshot directory.
A snapshot file is a JSON file containing information about this snapshot, including</description>

      <description>Concurrency Control #  Paimon supports optimistic concurrency for multiple concurrent write jobs.
Each job writes data at its own pace and generates a new snapshot based on the current snapshot by applying incremental files (deleting or adding files) at the time of committing.
There may be two types of commit failures here:
 Snapshot conflict: the snapshot id has been preempted, the table has generated a new snapshot from another job.</description>
