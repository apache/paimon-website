Write
=====
Batch writing requires the compute engine to specify the target ``partition``.
For fixed-bucket tables, the engine must also assign a valid bucket to every
``RecordBatch``. In unaware-bucket and postpone-bucket modes, the writer can
resolve the bucket automatically when it is omitted.

Paimon C++ uses Apache Arrow as the :ref:`in-memory columnar format<memory-format>`
to more efficiently support writing to disk columnar formats such as ORC,
Parquet, and Avro, thereby improving write throughput.

.. note::
  Currently supported table types:
    - Append table
    - Primary Key table

  Not supported in the current scope:

Bucketing Modes
---------------

- Append tables:

  * Support ``bucket = -1`` (unaware-bucket mode)
  * Support ``bucket > 0`` (fixed bucket mode)

- PK tables:

  * Support ``bucket = -2`` (postpone bucket mode)
  * Support ``bucket > 0`` (fixed bucket mode)

.. note::
   PK tables do not support dynamic bucketing (``bucket = -1``).

RecordBatch Construction
------------------------

- The compute engine must:

  - Assign the correct ``partition`` for each row.
  - In fixed-bucket mode, apply the Paimon-consistent bucketing function, set a
    bucket in ``[0, bucket)``, and group rows into Arrow ``RecordBatch`` objects
    per partition-bucket combination.

- In unaware-bucket mode (append table with ``bucket = -1``), an omitted bucket
  is resolved to ``0``.
- In postpone-bucket mode (primary-key table with ``bucket = -2``), an omitted
  bucket is resolved to ``-2``.

- Recommended practices:

  - Use schema-aligned Arrow arrays with explicit validity bitmaps and offsets.
  - Prefer batch sizes tuned for I/O throughput (e.g., tens to hundreds of MB per flush, depending on filesystem and cluster configuration).
  - Maintain stable sort orders within a batch only if required by downstream merge or compaction logic; otherwise avoid unnecessary ordering costs.

Writing BLOB Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``BLOB`` column is a ``LargeBinary`` field carrying Paimon's BLOB field
metadata, and an ``ARRAY<BLOB>`` column is a top-level ``List`` field whose
element field carries it. Build the BLOB field with ``paimon::Blob::ArrowField``
and import it into Arrow; the element field of an ``ARRAY<BLOB>`` column must
keep that metadata:

.. code-block:: cpp

   PAIMON_ASSIGN_OR_RAISE(std::unique_ptr<::ArrowSchema> c_element,
                          paimon::Blob::ArrowField("element", /*nullable=*/true));
   PAIMON_ASSIGN_OR_RAISE_FROM_ARROW(std::shared_ptr<arrow::Field> element,
                                     arrow::ImportField(c_element.get()));
   std::shared_ptr<arrow::Schema> schema = arrow::schema(
       {arrow::field("id", arrow::int32()), arrow::field("frames", arrow::list(element))});

For a column stored in blob files, which includes every ``ARRAY<BLOB>`` column,
each value or element holds either the raw bytes or a serialized
``paimon::BlobDescriptor`` produced by ``paimon::Blob::ToDescriptor``; the writer
copies the referenced data into the blob file. A BLOB column listed in
``blob-descriptor-field`` or ``blob-view-field`` keeps the reference in the data
file instead, so the referenced data must remain available.

If the referenced data cannot be reached, the write fails unless a write-null
option covers the failure: ``blob-write-null-on-missing-file`` covers a
referenced file that does not exist, and ``blob-write-null-on-fetch-failure``
covers any other failure to resolve the descriptor or open the data, including
a missing file when the former is disabled and an offset past the end of the
file for a descriptor with a dynamic length (``-1``). A covered value is written
as NULL; in an ``ARRAY<BLOB>`` only that element becomes NULL, not the array.
Any other failure fails the write, such as a failure to write the blob file or
to close a referenced file. As in Paimon Java, this includes a file too short
for the range of a descriptor with a known length, which is only detected while
the data is copied.
See :doc:`data_types` for the table requirements and restrictions.

A data-evolution write can update columns of existing rows. The write does not
locate the updated rows itself: before the commit, each file in its commit
messages must be assigned the first row id of the rows it covers. A write that
carries only columns stored in blob files is always such an update, and
committing it without that id fails. A BLOB column listed in
``blob-descriptor-field`` or ``blob-view-field`` is stored in the data file
instead. Paimon C++ does not assign that id and its public API cannot set it,
so the commit messages must be updated outside Paimon C++, for example by
Paimon Java after ``CommitMessage::Serialize``. The serialized payload does not
carry its serialization version, so send ``CommitMessage::CurrentVersion()``
with it, and pass ``CommitMessage::Deserialize`` the version the returned
payload was serialized with.

In such an update, a row whose BLOB or ``ARRAY<BLOB>`` value stays unchanged is
marked with the reserved bytes ``_PAIMON_BLOB_PLACEHOLDER``: as the value itself
for a BLOB column, or as the only element of the array for an ``ARRAY<BLOB>``
column. As in Paimon Java, the marker works whatever other columns the update
carries. Such a row keeps its value from the older files when read. Every write
stores a value equal to the reserved bytes as such a marker, so that value is
not supported.

.. note::
   The C++ writer differs from Paimon Java in these respects:

   - A placeholder is identified by the reserved bytes; Java uses a dedicated
     placeholder object, which cannot collide with a user value.
   - A missing file is detected with ``FileSystem::Exists``. Java detects a
     missing file for an ``ARRAY<BLOB>`` element only from an HTTP 404, and
     does not write NULL for a 404 under ``blob-write-null-on-fetch-failure``
     alone.
   - A descriptor with a dynamic length is copied up to the file length read
     when it is opened, so data appended to the file during the copy is left
     out, and a file truncated during the copy fails the write. Java reads it
     until the end of the file. Its offset past the end of the file also fails
     to open, whereas Java writes an empty value for it when the file system
     can seek past the end of a file, as the local one can.

Prepare Commit
----------------

The compute engine is responsible for triggering the writer nodes' ``PrepareCommit``.
Triggering conditions depend on the engine's business needs and can follow either:

- Streaming mode: time-based or periodic triggers (e.g., every N seconds).
- Batch mode: trigger after all data in the batch has been written.

Once the compute engine collects ``CommitMessages`` from all writer nodes, it
can issue a ``Commit`` request to the control plane (management path) to create
a new ``Snapshot``.

Compatibility Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure interoperability, the ``PrepareCommit`` result produced by Paimon C++
must be consumable by Paimon Java. Therefore:

- The structure and semantics of ``CommitMessage`` must remain consistent with
  Java Paimon.
- Any evolution of the Java-side ``CommitMessage`` schema must be tracked and
  validated on the C++ side to maintain cross-language compatibility.

Interface Design in Paimon C++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike Java Paimon, Paimon C++ does not expose ``BinaryRow``-like types in its
public interfaces. To preserve compatibility without leaking internal row
representations, Paimon C++ provides ``CommitMessage`` only through:

- Serialization: convert the internal commit state into a well-defined binary
  representation that matches Java Paimon's expectations.
- Deserialization: parse the Java-compatible binary representation back into
  C++ commit structures for validation, replay, or tooling needs.

This design ensures that:

- Public APIs are independent of Java-specific row abstractions.
- Cross-language commit payloads remain stable and versionable.
- Internal data layouts can evolve without breaking external consumers.

CommitMessage Contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``CommitMessage`` must encode all information required by the coordinator to
produce a correct ``Snapshot``, which commonly includes (but is not limited to):

- Partition and bucket identifiers associated with written data.
- New data files, delete files (as applicable to the table type).
- File-level metadata required for manifest and index updates (e.g., row counts, min/max statistics where applicable).
- Transactional markers and sequence numbers as required by table semantics.
- Any per-writer state necessary for deduplication or idempotent commits.

.. note::

   The C++ writer supports Append and PK tables and can produce
   ``CommitMessage`` objects for both. ``FileStoreCommit`` supports direct
   file-system commits for both table types on non-object-store paths.
   Object-store paths require REST catalog commit mode. Changelog is out of
   scope and should not be emitted in ``CommitMessage`` until explicitly
   supported.

Serialization and Deserialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Binary format:** The binary payload must strictly conform to Java Paimon's
  ``CommitMessage`` encoding. It does not contain a version tag, so callers
  must transport ``CommitMessage::CurrentVersion()`` separately and supply it
  when deserializing.
- **Serialization API:** Use ``CommitMessage::Serialize`` for one message or
  ``CommitMessage::SerializeList`` for a list.
- **Deserialization API:** Use ``CommitMessage::Deserialize`` or
  ``CommitMessage::DeserializeList`` with the separately supplied
  serialization version.
- **Validation:** Conformance and round-trip tests must verify compatibility
  with Java Paimon for supported message versions.

Operational Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Writer nodes perform data ingestion and produce Arrow ``RecordBatch``
   organized by partition and bucket.

2. Writers flush batches into ORC, Parquet, or Avro files via registered
   ``file.format`` and ``file-system`` backends, producing file-level metadata
   and per-batch commit state.

3. Each writer invokes ``PrepareCommit``, which:
   - Aggregates per-writer state into ``CommitMessage`` objects.
   - Returns ``CommitMessage`` objects; it does not serialize them.

4. The compute engine gathers ``CommitMessage`` objects from all writers. For
   cross-process transport, it explicitly calls ``Serialize`` or
   ``SerializeList`` and carries ``CurrentVersion()`` alongside the payload.

5. For a direct file-system commit on a non-object-store path, the engine
   passes the objects to ``FileStoreCommit`` for either an Append or PK table.
   For a table of a catalog which owns its versions, such as a REST catalog, it
   passes that catalog and the table identifier to
   ``WriteContextBuilder::WithCatalog`` and ``CommitContextBuilder::WithCatalog``.
   The writer loads the latest snapshot from the catalog, and the current schema
   from it as well when it writes to the main branch; a write aimed at another
   branch reads the schema published under ``branch/branch-<name>`` instead. On
   ``Commit``, the snapshot and the statistics of the change go to the catalog,
   which decides whether this commit wins, and one that lost the race is rebased
   and retried the way a file-system commit is. A caller without a catalog
   client can instead enable REST catalog commit mode, call ``Commit``, obtain
   the JSON request from ``GetLastCommitTableRequest``, and send that request to
   the REST catalog itself. That request body names no branch, so a commit aimed
   at one has to be sent to the URL of ``tbl$branch_dev`` rather than of ``tbl``.

6. The local committer or REST catalog validates the messages, updates
   manifests/metadata, and finalizes the snapshot atomically.
