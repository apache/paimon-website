Format Table
============
A format table is a directory that holds multiple files of the same format. It carries no
snapshots and no manifests: the files in the directory are the table, so reading it lists
directories and writing to it adds files. A table is a format table when its ``type`` option is
``format-table``; ``file.format`` then names the format of every file in it, which here is
``parquet`` or ``orc``.

A partitioned format table uses the standard Hive directory layout, and its partitions are
discovered from that layout rather than from metadata. By default a partition directory is named
``key=value``; setting ``format-table.partition-path-only-value`` names it by the value alone.

Because a directory of plain files records no row identity, a format table only accepts inserts.
Reads still carry the leading ``_VALUE_KIND`` field every ``BatchReader`` promises, so an engine
that reads a batch by field index sees the same layout it does for a managed table; every row of a
format table is an insert.

Reading and writing
-------------------
A format table is not served through :cpp:func:`Catalog::GetTable`, which describes a managed
table; use :cpp:func:`Catalog::GetFormatTable` instead.

Reading and writing go through the entry points every other table uses: ``TableScan::Create``,
``TableRead::Create``, ``FileStoreWrite::Create`` and ``FileStoreCommit::Create``, each from its
usual context builder. Each reads the table's schema - from under the table path, or from the one
the context carries - and dispatches to a format table when its ``type`` says so.

That path needs a schema under the table's own location, which is what every table a file system
catalog serves has. A table loaded from a catalog that keeps the schema elsewhere, such as the
REST catalog, has none: nothing under the location says that it is a format table, nor that
``schema`` and ``branch`` below it are data rather than metadata. Such a table is read and written
by handing the loaded ``FormatTable`` to the context instead of a path - every context builder has
a constructor taking one - which is what Java does through ``FormatTable.newReadBuilder()`` and
``newBatchWriteBuilder()``:

.. code-block:: cpp

   PAIMON_ASSIGN_OR_RAISE(std::shared_ptr<paimon::FormatTable> table,
                          catalog->GetFormatTable(paimon::Identifier("db", "tbl")));
   paimon::ScanContextBuilder scan_builder(table);
   PAIMON_ASSIGN_OR_RAISE(std::unique_ptr<paimon::ScanContext> scan_context,
                          scan_builder.Finish());
   PAIMON_ASSIGN_OR_RAISE(std::unique_ptr<paimon::TableScan> scan,
                          paimon::TableScan::Create(std::move(scan_context)));

The table already carries its schema and the file system it was loaded through, so a context built
from one refuses ``SetTableSchema()``, ``WithFileSystem()``,
``WithFileSystemSchemeToIdentifierMap()``, ``WithCatalog()`` and a branch. Options
given at the call still win over the ones the schema stored, as they do everywhere else.

A batch comes back in the table's column order, or the projection's when the read names one,
behind the ``_VALUE_KIND`` field every ``BatchReader`` carries. Which columns a *file* is asked for
and in what order is its own business: they are matched to the table's by name, as Java matches
them through ``ParquetReaderFactory`` and orc's schema evolution, so a file that stores them in
another order is read in the order it stores them, and one holding columns the table does not name
is read past. A column the file does not hold is filled with nulls, which is how a file written
before a column was added is still read - unless the table declares that column ``NOT NULL``, when
the file is refused instead, as Java's ``VectorizedParquetRecordReader`` refuses it. Only the
columns a read actually asks a file for are held to the table's schema: a partition column is
rebuilt from the directory name whether or not the file stores one of its own, and a column
outside the projection is never read, which is how Java scopes the same checks.

``FormatTable`` is the only format-table type in the public API. The classes behind it -
``FormatTableScan``, ``FormatTableRead``, ``FormatTableWrite``, ``FormatTableCommit``,
``FormatDataSplit`` and ``FormatCommitMessage`` - are implementation details under ``src`` and are
named here only to describe what happens. A caller never needs them: a plan comes back as
``Plan``, a split as ``Split``, and a commit message as ``CommitMessage``.

A catalog that can load a format table itself overrides ``Catalog::LoadFormatTable()``, the
protected hook :cpp:func:`Catalog::GetFormatTable` calls. The file system catalog uses it to say
its metadata lives under the table location, and the REST catalog to take the location and the
schema from one response instead of two that could disagree. A catalog that does not override it
still serves format tables, by reading the location and the schema through the virtuals every
catalog has.

``TableScan::ListPartitions()`` lists the partitions a scan can see. A format table answers it by
listing directories; every other table type returns ``NotImplemented`` for now.

Not all of the generic interfaces fit. ``FileStoreCommit`` is mostly about snapshots and manifests -
expiring them, rolling back to one, filtering by a commit identifier recorded in one - and a format
table keeps none of that state, so those calls are refused rather than quietly doing nothing.
``FileStoreWrite::Compact()`` is refused for the same reason, and both write and commit take batch
writes only, since there is no snapshot to record a commit identifier or a watermark in.
``TableScan`` takes a partition filter and a limit; a predicate or a bucket filter is refused. Java
refuses a predicate from ``FormatTableScan.withFilter`` too, but ``FormatReadBuilder.newScan()``
splits one first and hands the partition half to the scan, so there a predicate over partition
columns still prunes directories. See the limits below.

Options given at the call win over the ones the schema stored, as they do for every other table -
except ``type``, which is structural and is read from the schema alone, so one read or write
cannot decide what kind of table this is. The merged result is validated, not the schema's own
options, so an option a format table refuses - ``metastore.partitioned-table``, a file format
nothing here can read - is refused wherever it comes from rather than dropped in silence.

A setting the format path cannot act on is refused by name rather than quietly dropped:

* ``ReadContextBuilder::SetReadSchema()``. A projected read schema can rename a column, prune a
  nested one and give it metadata of its own; a format table's projection is a list of top-level
  names, so name the columns instead.
* ``WithStreamingMode()`` on a scan or a write, a global index result on a scan, and a real-time
  context on a scan, a read or a write: a format table has no snapshots, no real-time store and no
  index.
* ``WriteContextBuilder::WithWriteSchema()``, which names a subset of the columns to write.
* ``WriteContextBuilder::WithWriteId()``, which prefixes a postpone-bucket writer's files so one
  compaction reader can put them back in order; a format table has no buckets.
* ``CommitContextBuilder::IgnoreEmptyCommit(false)``, ``UseRESTCatalogCommit(true)``,
  ``WithTableId()``, ``WithCatalog()`` and ``AppendCommitCheckConflict(true)``. Keeping an empty
  commit means writing a snapshot that adds no files, a rest-catalog commit sends that snapshot to
  a catalog, a table id names the table in the request that commit sends, committing through a
  catalog hands it a snapshot to take, and the conflict check reads the manifests of concurrent
  commits - none of which exist here. Each is refused only when set away from its default, so an
  ordinary commit is unaffected.
* the ``branch`` option, whatever names it: a format table keeps no metadata to branch, and its
  data is the files under its one location, which is where a read or a write would go whichever
  branch was asked for. It is refused wherever it comes from - the schema, a catalog that parsed
  ``tbl$branch_dev``, or the options of a single call - and so is ``WithBranch()`` on a context
  built from a format table. A branch quietly ignored would be the wrong answer everywhere and a
  destructive one for an overwrite, which would clear the data it was told not to touch. The
  value naming the main branch is the default and is left alone.
* A scan predicate or bucket filter, as above, and more than one partition filter: a scan descends
  one directory layout, so it takes the values of a single partition rather than a set of them.

What a data file is opened with is not one of the refusals. ``EnablePrefetch()``, the read-ahead
cache and its ``CacheConfig``, and the ``Cache`` a read carries all apply, because a format table
opens its files through the same component the managed table path opens its own with. What differs
between the two paths is which files there are and how a row is put back together, not how a file
is read.

Some settings are not refused because they describe machinery the format path never reaches, and
refusing them would refuse the defaults: ``EnableMultiThreadRowToBatch()`` on a read, a write's
temporary directory and spill configuration, and ``WithIgnoreNumBucketCheck()`` and
``WithIgnorePreviousFiles()`` on a write. They have no effect here: a format read hands out the
batches parquet or orc already produced rather than assembling them from rows, a format write
buffers in memory and never spills, and a table with no buckets has no bucket count to check and
no previous files to read back.

A write is two-phase, since a directory has no metadata to switch atomically: a file is written
into a ``_temporary`` directory beside where it will end up, under a hidden name of its own, and
only the commit renames it into place. That is the layout Java Paimon's
``RenamingTwoPhaseOutputStream`` stages under. The directory and the name are both hidden, the
convention a Hive-style directory uses for output that is not committed table data, and what a scan
of this table skips. The ``_temporary`` directory is shared with every other writer
of the same table and is left behind after a commit.

An overwriting commit clears what it replaces before publishing anything. What it replaces is the
static partition when one is given - the partitions below that prefix, whether or not this commit
wrote to them - and otherwise the partitions the commit actually writes to, when
``dynamic-partition-overwrite`` is on, its default, and the table is partitioned. With the option
off, or for an unpartitioned table, it replaces the whole table instead, which is the condition
Java's ``FormatTableCommit`` and a managed table commit both apply. An overwrite that replaces the
table empties it even when it publishes no file, so a statement whose query returns nothing still
clears what was there.

A plan is in-memory only. ``FormatDataSplit`` has no serialized form - ``Split::Serialize()``
refuses it - and neither has ``FormatCommitMessage``: a format table's plan has no cross-runtime
encoding, so plan, read and commit within one process.

A ``FormatTableWrite`` and a ``FormatTableCommit`` are each driven by one thread, but separate
ones may fill and add to a table at once: each write stages its files under a uuid of its own, and
each commit publishes only the files its own messages name. Two *overwriting* commits over the
same directory race, since an overwrite clears what is committed there before publishing anything.
A ``FormatTableScan`` may be shared, since planning leaves it as it was.

``TableRead::CreateCountReader()`` is not implemented for a format table, so counting its rows
means reading them. That is a gap here rather than something the layout forces: ``parquet`` and
``orc`` both record a row count in their own footer.

A writer starts a new file once the one it is filling reaches ``target-file-row-num`` rows or
``target-file-size`` bytes. Both are checked between batches rather than between rows, because a
batch is the unit this API writes in, so a file may pass either target by up to one batch. Java
checks the row count on every row and the size every thousand rows, and its files therefore sit
closer to the target.

Aborting a write
----------------
``FormatTableWrite::Abort()`` removes the files the write staged. It is the one call still allowed
after ``PrepareCommit()``, and that is what it is for: a write dropped *before* preparing clears
its staged files from its own destructor, so only a commit that is prepared and then abandoned
needs it.

Path containment is checked on the path text, which stops a ``..`` from leaving the table but not
a symbolic link pointing out of it - the same as Java's own local file system behaviour. A
relative local location is resolved against the working directory first, as the local file system
resolves one while opening a file, so a table located at ``./table`` and the absolute paths its
own listing hands back are recognised as the same place. ``FormatTable::Location()`` still reports
the location as it was given.

``FormatTableCommit::Abort()`` does the same for the messages a commit was given. **Neither undoes
a commit that succeeded**: once a file has been renamed into place it is no longer staged, and
nothing here will take it back. Java's committer removes the published path as well as the staged
one, which matters there because a commit publishes file by file with nothing watching; here a
commit that fails part way takes back every target it tried to publish before it returns, so an
abort is left with the staged files alone. That includes the target of the rename the commit
failed on, which a store may have produced before failing to say so - on an object store a rename
is a copy followed by a delete, and a request that took effect but lost its response looks like
one that did nothing. The target is removed on the strength of it belonging to this write: its
name carries the uuid of the write that staged it, and no two messages of one commit may name the
same target. An overwriting commit is the exception: it has already deleted what it replaces, so
taking the published files back too would leave neither the old rows nor the new, and they are
kept. Java preserves them for the same reason.

Both are best effort and never fail here, so a warning in the log is the only signal that a file
could not be removed - and a published target left behind is one a scan goes on to read. Java's
``abort`` instead collects its failures and reports them.

Give ``FormatTableCommit`` only the messages this job's own writers produced. A message names a
staged file by path, and a commit can tell that the path belongs to this table, sits in the
partition the message declares, and is staged rather than already published - not whose staged file
it is. A well-formed message from somewhere else is published, or discarded by ``Abort()``, like
any other.

Relationship to Java Paimon
---------------------------
Java serves format tables from a Hive or REST catalog, which holds the schema. This implementation
also serves them from a file system catalog, which keeps the schema under the table directory - an
extension Java does not have. Only for such a table are the ``schema`` and ``branch`` directories
below the location treated as metadata rather than as data.

A file system catalog keeps a table's schema in ``schema`` and its branches in ``branch`` below
the table location, so under ``format-table.partition-path-only-value`` the first partition value
may not be ``schema`` or ``branch``: the directory a write would use is the one holding the
table's own metadata. Such a write is refused, as is an overwrite naming that partition - which
would otherwise delete the schema. A table served from a REST or Hive catalog keeps its schema
elsewhere, so there these are ordinary partition values and are read and written like any other.

Under that same layout a partition value may not start with ``_`` or ``.`` either, whichever
catalog serves the table: the value is the whole directory name, and a scan skips every hidden
name. Java writes such a directory and then cannot read it back; here the write is refused
instead. The one exception is the value standing for a null partition, ``partition.default-name``,
which the scan reads at a partition level by design. Under the ``key=value`` layout the question
does not arise, since the key in front of the value keeps the directory name visible.

A few smaller differences come from this library's own conventions:

* a write takes one partition per batch: the batch declares it through
  ``RecordBatchBuilder::SetPartition()`` and every row of that batch is stored under it. Java
  routes row by row, so one write call there may land in any number of partitions;
* a write takes its partition from ``RecordBatchBuilder::SetPartition()`` rather than from the
  rows. A row's own partition column is not checked against the declaration and never reads back:
  a format table's partition columns are rebuilt from the directory name, as a managed table's are
  from the manifest, and the managed write path takes ``RecordBatch::GetPartition()`` on the same
  terms. The values arrive as text. They are still read into their column types and rendered back
  out before anything is named after them - the round trip Java's writer makes when it renders a
  partition out of the row it is writing, through the partition computer its
  ``FileStorePathFactory`` holds. The table therefore decides the directory name and the commit
  message, not the spelling the caller used: with ``partition.legacy-name`` on, its default, a
  ``DATE`` partition is written as its day count whether the caller wrote ``19723`` or
  ``2024-01-01``, and as ``YYYY-MM-DD`` when the option is off. A value that cannot be read into
  its column type is refused. ``FormatTableCommit``'s static partition is *not* put through that
  round trip and is used as given, which is what Java's ``FormatTableCommit.buildPartitionPath``
  does with it too;
* a commit message carries the partition its file belongs to, and a commit checks that it agrees
  with the directory the file sits in. Java's message carries none and derives the partition from
  the committer's target path, so the two cannot disagree there. A message here reaches the commit
  through the base ``CommitMessage`` type, so the value is checked rather than trusted;
* a projection that names the same column twice is rejected when the read is built. Java reads
  such a column once per entry;
* a row limit is the caller's. ``FormatTableScan`` takes one, but a format table records no row
  counts, so only a non-positive limit prunes anything - it plans nothing at all. A positive one
  neither drops splits nor bounds the reader ``FormatTableRead`` hands out, so the caller stops
  calling ``NextBatch()`` once it has enough. Java wraps its reader in a ``LimitRecordReader``.

Current limits
--------------
The layout, the option precedence and the read, write and overwrite semantics described above
follow Java Paimon's. What this implementation covers is nonetheless a subset of what Java's
format table does; it does not yet support:

* the ``csv``, ``json``, ``text`` and ``mosaic`` file formats, leaving ``parquet`` and ``orc``.
  The first three are line-delimited text in Java, which shares one line-reading layer between
  them; this library has no text file format at all, so the first of them to be added has to bring
  that layer with it. ``mosaic`` is none of those: it has a reader and a writer of its own, which
  this library builds under ``PAIMON_ENABLE_MOSAIC``, but a format table does not reach them yet;
* cutting one large data file into byte ranges so that several readers share it. Java does this
  for an uncompressed ``csv`` or ``json`` file written with the default line delimiter, and for no
  other format - not for ``text`` or ``mosaic`` either; ``parquet`` and ``orc`` each record where
  their own row groups and stripes begin, and a reader handed a byte range of one would have to
  find that out for itself;
* ``metastore.partitioned-table``, which moves partition visibility into the catalog, and the
  Hive partition sync that goes with it;
* partition filters beyond equality on partition values, where Java accepts a full predicate. The
  values are compared through their column type, as Java's are, but discovery here lists one
  directory level at a time and tests each name's value, while Java turns a leading run of
  equality constraints into a path and starts listing below it; a table with many partitions
  therefore costs more listings here than in Java;
* ``scan.ignore-corrupt-files`` and ``scan.ignore-lost-files``, which are not implemented: a
  corrupt or missing data file fails the read rather than being skipped;
* reading a column whose type in the file is not the type the table declares. A column is matched
  by name and then read as the table declares it, so a file storing it as some other type fails
  the read rather than being converted to that type. Java's orc reader converts a few such pairs,
  through orc's own schema evolution. The same goes for a ``STRUCT`` whose children the file
  orders differently, which the read refuses rather than putting back in the table's order. A
  ``TIMESTAMP`` of another unit is the one difference the read carries, and how far depends on
  the format: an orc file records no unit at all - a value is a seconds-plus-nanoseconds pair,
  built at whatever precision the read asks for - so any unit is read as the table declares it,
  while a parquet file records the unit its values are in and only ``MILLI`` under a ``SECOND``
  column is rescaled, the pair parquet's own round trip needs, every other being refused rather
  than relabelled;
* ``FileStoreCommit::TruncateTable()``, which Java implements for a format table by deleting its
  data files while leaving the partition directories in place, and
  ``FileStoreCommit::DropPartition()``, which would remove a partition directory outright. An
  overwrite of a partition with no messages empties it but leaves the directory, which is what
  Java's ``truncatePartitions()`` does rather than a drop;
* ``format-table.commit-hive-sync-url``, which registers committed partitions with a Hive
  metastore;
* column default values. Java replaces a null in a column whose schema field declares a default
  with that default as it writes; here the null is written as it came;
* a table every one of whose columns is a partition column. Java projects the partition columns
  out of what it writes, leaving files that carry nothing but a row count; here such a schema is
  refused when the table is created and when it is opened;
* ``TIMESTAMP``, ``DECIMAL``, ``FLOAT`` and ``DOUBLE`` partition columns, which Java allows. This
  is a restriction of the whole library rather than of format tables. The types that do work are
  ``BOOLEAN``, ``TINYINT``, ``SMALLINT``, ``INT``, ``BIGINT``, ``STRING`` and ``DATE`` - the set
  the managed table path reads and writes partitions in. Any other, ``BINARY`` among them, is
  refused when the table is created and when it is opened, rather than at the first read or write:
  validation asks by building the partition computer that does the round trip, so there is one
  answer rather than a list of types that could fall out of step with it.

``data-file.path-directory`` has no effect here, and none in Java either: Java's format table
writer builds its paths from the table root rather than from that directory.
``format-table.implementation`` is honoured by the engines rather than by the table - in Java
Spark it selects between Paimon's own implementation and the engine's ``FileTable`` - so it has
no meaning inside this library.

Validation
----------
A table Java can serve and this library cannot is refused at creation rather than accepted and
then found unopenable, whichever catalog it is created through. It can still reach a catalog
another way - written by Java, or by an older client - so the same checks run again when the
table is opened.
