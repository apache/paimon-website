Catalog
==========================
Paimon C++ provides a :ref:`Catalog abstraction <cpp-api-catalog>` to manage the table of contents and metadata. The Catalog
abstraction provides a series of ways to help you better integrate with computing engines. We always
recommend that you use Catalog to access the Paimon table.

Paimon C++ supports two metastores, selected with the catalog option
``metastore``: the filesystem metastore (default) and the REST metastore.

Filesystem Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The filesystem metastore (``metastore=filesystem``, the default) stores both
metadata and table files in filesystems. The ``root_path`` argument of
``Catalog::Create`` is the warehouse directory holding the databases and tables.

REST Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~
With the REST metastore (``metastore=rest``), catalog metadata is managed by a
remote catalog server exposed through a REST API; table data itself is still read
and written through the table paths returned by the server. See `Java Paimon REST
Catalog <https://paimon.apache.org/docs/master/concepts/rest/>`_ for the concept
and the server-side protocol.

REST catalog support is an optional build component: configure the build with
``-DPAIMON_ENABLE_REST=ON`` (see :ref:`cpp_build_optional_components`).

When ``metastore=rest``, the ``root_path`` argument of ``Catalog::Create`` is not
a filesystem path but the warehouse (instance) name under which the tables are
registered on the REST server. The catalog is configured through the
``CatalogOptions`` keys:

* ``metastore``: must be ``rest`` to select the REST catalog.
* ``uri``: server url of the REST catalog server.
* ``token.provider``: authentication provider of the REST catalog; currently only
  ``bear`` is supported (the protocol's historical spelling of "bearer").
* ``token``: token of the ``bear`` token provider.
* ``table-default.<key>``: table option defaults applied when a created table
  left ``<key>`` unset.
* ``header.<name>``: sent as the ``<name>`` http header on every request to the
  server. The server may configure headers of its own through the ``/v1/config``
  endpoint, which are merged with these as any other option is.

.. code-block:: cpp

   std::map<std::string, std::string> options = {
       {"metastore", "rest"},
       {"uri", "http://127.0.0.1:8080"},
       {"token.provider", "bear"},
       {"token", "<token>"},
   };
   PAIMON_ASSIGN_OR_RAISE(std::unique_ptr<paimon::Catalog> catalog,
                          paimon::Catalog::Create(/*root_path=*/"my_instance", options));

On creation the catalog queries the server's ``/v1/config`` endpoint and merges
its response with the options above: the server's overrides win over the client
options, which in turn win over the server's defaults.

Databases and tables are then created, listed, loaded, renamed and dropped
through the regular ``Catalog`` API, and table snapshots can be listed through
``Catalog::ListSnapshots``.

The C++ REST catalog covers the database, table and snapshot operations of the
``Catalog`` API. The parts of the Java REST catalog that have no C++ counterpart
yet — altering a database or a table, views, functions, partitions, tags, branch
management and consumers — are not supported, and neither is the ``dlf`` token
provider.
