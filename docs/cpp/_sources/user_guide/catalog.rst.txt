Catalog
==========================
C++ Paimon provides a :ref:`Catalog abstraction <cpp-api-catalog>` to manage the table of contents and metadata. The Catalog
abstraction provides a series of ways to help you better integrate with computing engines. We always
recommend that you use Catalog to access the Paimon table.

Filesystem Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
C++ Paimon catalog currently support one types of metastores filesystem metastore (default),
which stores both metadata and table files in filesystems.

.. note::

  Current C++ Paimon only supports filesystem catalog. In the future, we will
  support REST catalog.
  By using the Paimon REST catalog, changes to the catalog will be directly stored
  in a remote catalog server which exposed through REST API. See `Java Paimon REST
  Catalog <https://paimon.apache.org/docs/master/concepts/rest/overview/>`_.
