Integrating Paimon C++
======================

This section assumes that you have already built and installed the Paimon C++
libraries on your system after :ref:`building them yourself <building-paimon-cpp>`.
Additionally, you will need `Apache Arrow for C++ <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/getting_started.html>`_
as in-memory data format interface. Please ensure that Arrow C++ is installed
and available to your build system

The recommended way to integrate the Paimon C++ libraries into your C++ project
is to use CMake's `find_package <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html>`_
function to locate and integrate dependencies.

CMake
=====

Quick Start
-----------

This ``CMakeLists.txt`` compiles the ``my_example.cc`` source file into
an executable and links it with the Paimon C++ shared library and its plugins
for data format and file system.

.. code-block:: cmake

   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)

   project(MyExample)

   # Arrow's static package may export LZ4 under a different target name.
   find_package(lz4 CONFIG QUIET)
   if(TARGET LZ4::lz4_static AND NOT TARGET LZ4::lz4)
     add_library(LZ4::lz4 ALIAS LZ4::lz4_static)
   elseif(TARGET lz4::lz4 AND NOT TARGET LZ4::lz4)
     add_library(LZ4::lz4 ALIAS lz4::lz4)
   endif()

   find_package(Arrow CONFIG REQUIRED)
   find_package(Paimon CONFIG REQUIRED)

   if(TARGET Arrow::arrow_shared)
     set(PAIMON_ARROW_TARGET Arrow::arrow_shared)
   elseif(TARGET Arrow::arrow_static)
     set(PAIMON_ARROW_TARGET Arrow::arrow_static)
   else()
     message(FATAL_ERROR "No supported Arrow CMake target is available")
   endif()

   add_executable(my_example my_example.cc)
   target_link_libraries(my_example PRIVATE ${PAIMON_ARROW_TARGET}
                                            Paimon::paimon_shared
                                            Paimon::paimon_parquet_file_format_shared
                                            Paimon::paimon_local_file_system_shared)

Available variables and targets
-------------------------------

The directive ``find_package(Paimon REQUIRED)`` instructs CMake to locate a
Paimon C++ installation on your system. If successful, it sets ``Paimon_FOUND``
to true if the Paimon C++ libraries were found.

It defines the following supported imported target:

* ``Paimon::paimon_shared`` links to the Paimon shared libraries

Static targets such as ``Paimon::paimon_static`` may also be present when
Paimon is built with ``PAIMON_BUILD_STATIC=ON``. They are not currently
supported as standalone installed targets because their exported link
interfaces do not include every third-party dependency. Installed consumers
should use the shared targets.

Optional plugins (built-in file formats, file systems, and index)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Paimon provides a set of built-in optional plugins that you can link to as needed:

- File format plugins:

  - ``Paimon::paimon_parquet_file_format_shared``
  - ``Paimon::paimon_orc_file_format_shared``
  - ``Paimon::paimon_avro_file_format_shared``
  - ``Paimon::paimon_blob_file_format_shared``

- File system plugins:

  - ``Paimon::paimon_local_file_system_shared``
  - ``Paimon::paimon_jindo_file_system_shared``

- Index plugins:

  - ``Paimon::paimon_file_index_shared``
  - ``Paimon::paimon_lumina_index_shared``
  - ``Paimon::paimon_lucene_index_shared``

.. note::

  Static plugin targets have the same installed-consumer limitation as
  ``Paimon::paimon_static`` and should not be used as standalone imported
  targets.
