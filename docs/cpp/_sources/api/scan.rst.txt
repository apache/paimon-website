Bucket pruning
==============

For fixed-bucket append and primary-key tables, an equality predicate on every bucket key lets
the scan derive the target bucket using the table's bucket function. Other buckets
are excluded from the scan plan without requiring an explicit bucket ID from the
caller. An explicit bucket filter takes precedence. Queries that do not constrain
all bucket keys with equality, and bucket-unaware tables, keep the existing scan
behavior. Both scan types use a shared selector that computes the bucket with
each manifest entry's total bucket count, so rescaled files are not filtered using
the current table's bucket count. Historical schemas remain eligible when their ordered bucket-key field IDs,
types and bucket function match. Changes to unrelated columns do not disable
pruning. Incompatible bucket schemas and nonpositive total bucket counts retain
the existing filtering behavior.

This inference prunes data files at the manifest-entry level. Manifest min/max-bucket
skipping requires an explicit bucket filter. When the snapshot live-manifest-entry
cache is enabled, inferred scans cache candidates by bucket, current bucket count
and current schema ID. Files with other bucket counts or schema IDs remain in the
cached candidates and are filtered after lookup. This permits cache reuse without
discarding files that require a different bucket calculation or schema fallback.

Decimal literals are rescaled to the bucket field's type only when the conversion
is exact. NaN literals and decimals that cannot be represented exactly disable
inferred bucket pruning.
